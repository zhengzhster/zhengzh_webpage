Zheng is a Research Scientist in [Prof. Dr. Phil Bourne’s lab](https://bournelab.org/) at the University of Virginia School of Data Science and Department of Biomedical Engineering. Zheng earned his Ph.D in Bioinformatics from University of Science and Technology of China (Advisor: Prof. Dr. Haiyan Liu; Thesis Title: Multiple Levels of Theory Approaches to QM/MM Studies of Enzyme Mechanisms).

Zheng's research is about Health and Biomedical Data Science, mainly focusing on the method development and application of computational system pharmacology and machine/deep learning. Specifically, he strives to develop new methods and models for drug screening, drug target prediction and validation, and drug polypharmacology, and carry out disease-associated studies in drug design and discovery, drug repurposing, drug mechanisms of action, etc, contributing to treating intractable diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson Disease, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Melanoma, and Leukemia.
